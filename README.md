## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview<br>
This project demonstrates the containerization of a multi-app Django web application using Docker. The setup ensures a consistent runtime environment, making the application portable, scalable, and easy to deploy.

##âœ… Why Use Docker?<br>
ðŸ›  Isolation: The Django application runs inside its own container, avoiding conflicts with other services or dependencies.
-Consistency: The environment remains the same across development, testing, and production.
-Portability: Easily deploy the containerized application on any system or cloud platform.
-Scalability: Docker allows horizontal scaling by running multiple containers simultaneously.

##ðŸ”§ How It Works<br>
ðŸ“„ Dockerfile: Sets up a lightweight Python environment, installs dependencies, and copies the Django project files into the container.

ðŸ¤– Jenkinsfile (CI/CD Pipeline): Automates the process by:
+Pulling the latest code from the GitHub repository.
+Building the Docker image.
+Pushing the built image to Docker Hub.

Running the Application: Once the Docker image is built and pushed, the Django app can be run as a container, accessible via the configured port.
